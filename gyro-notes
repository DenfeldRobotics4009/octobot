Idea #1: Compass-based field orientation
-Get compass value at start of match from IMUSimple library
-Use DriverStation.getAlliance() to get alliance
-Get field orientation for event from radio button on driver station (Blue North, Blue South, Blue East, Blue West)
-based on value for getAlliance() and value recieved from driver station, figure out how the joystick will work

#2: gyro-based field orientation
-Get gyro value at start of match
-gyro 0 = robot forward, gyro 180 = robot backward, etc (or something idk)
